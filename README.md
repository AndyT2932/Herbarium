## App description
Herbarium is a web application that enables users to document and track plants they encounter in the wild. With a user-friendly interface, it allows individuals to upload photos of plants, which are then analyzed and classified using a machine learning algorithm trained on a diverse plant database. Users can log their discoveries, view details about each species, and contribute to a growing community-driven plant collection. An interactive map feature highlights plant sightings around the world, fostering global awareness and collaboration in plant identification and biodiversity tracking.
